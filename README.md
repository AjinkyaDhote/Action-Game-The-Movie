# Action-Game-The-Movie is a student thesis project from the Entertainment and Arts Program of University of Utah. It is a game which
tries to complement two different genres which are strategy and shooting. Action Game is a rail road shooter where you lay the rails 
before you grab the gun. It dwells on the unique mechanic of planning the action in 2D phase and living the action in the 
3D phase. 

2D Controls 
-LMB to move
-Key "Z" to undo the move. 
-Key "A" to Start Playing in 3D Phase.

2D view also has heat maps which display the enemy intensity in that area. You need to manage your resources which are battery and ammo
on the way to reach the exit point. Every move costs some battery. Ammo is needed to kill the enemies in 3D Phase.

In 3D Phase you are on a rail which was laid in 2D planning phase. You can shoot the enemies using the guns and use bullet time to slow
down time.
